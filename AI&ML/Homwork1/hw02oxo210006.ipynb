            " <p> Basketball United States Wins Bronze Medal : The United States used another comeback yesterday to take the bronze medal at the world championships in Buenos Aires beating Puerto Rico by 107-105 in overtime. Kenny Anderson scored 34 points and made two free throws with one second left to send the game into overtime after Puerto Rico led by 8 points with 1 minute 34 seconds to play in the second half. Yugoslavia which beat the United States in the semifinals will face the Soviet Union for the gold medal today. This was the fourth straight international tournament in which the United States had failed to win a gold. Any medal for the United States looked out of the question with 1:34 left in regulation when Raymond Gausse's 3-pointer gave Puerto Rico a 96-88 lead. Then Anderson hit a jumper with 1:21 to play to get the United States within 6 and Puerto Rico opted for possession rather than foul shots four times in the final 1:19. After a backcourt violation Anderson made two free throws with 51 seconds left. Todd Day scored 14 seconds later another Puerto Rico turnover. Jose Ortiz who had 25 points and 11 rebounds tried to inbound the ball but overthrew Federico Lopez and the Americans had possession and a chance for their third comeback victory in the tournament. Anderson took the ball drove into two players and took a jumper. He was fouled and hit two free throws to make the score 96-96. The United States scored the first 4 points of overtime. Edgar Leon scored inside for Puerto Rico with 2:37 left then Anderson gave the United States a 5-point cushion with a 3-pointer 27 seconds later. ( AP ) Diving Titles for Ferguson and Williams : Kent Ferguson regained his 3-meter springboard title and Wendy Williams successfully defended her platform title yesterday at the national outdoor championships in Dallas. Ferguson overtook the leader and defending three-meter champion Mark Bradshaw in the fifth round of dives then led the rest of the way finishing with 653. 70 points. Scott Donie was second with 628. 56. Matt Scoggin took third with 620. 19 . She moved into the lead on her next dive and increased the margin to 30 points over Kathy Carboy. Carboy ended with 378. 96 points beating Kelly Jenkins who had 365. 34. The championships end today with the finals in the women's 3-meter springboard and men's 10-meter platform. ( AP ) Boxing Benn Stops Barkley Quickly : Nigel Benn of Britain retained his World Boxing Organization middleweight championship yesterday by stopping Iran Barkley of New York in the first round of their scheduledJU 12-round bout in Las Vegas Nev. Benn knocked down Barkley three times in the first round ending the bout under Nevada rules. The end came at 2:57. There was momentary confusion however over whether the bout was over. Referee Carlos Padilla had to confer with members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission to determine whether Barkley's third time on the canvas was a knockdown or just a slip. The commissioners ruled that Benn's last flurry two rights to the head and a third right that missed had produced World Boxing Council middleweight champion with a 25-7 record and 16 knockouts. Bennhas a 27-1 mark with 25 knockouts. ( AP ) Golf 2 or 24 Share Lead : There were either 2 or 24 co-leaders yesterday after the third round of the International tournament in Castle Rock Colo. The scoreboard at the Castle Pines Golf Club showed Eduardo Romero of Argentina and Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain tied for the top spot with 26 points each. But under the peculiar format for the event they were in effect tied with 22 others some of whom were 10 points behind them. The top 24 point-makers from the first three days ' play advanced to today's final round and at that point all scores reverted to zero so the 54-hole lead was meaningless. There were no leaders only survivors. In fact the third-round co-leaders did n't even win unofficial day money that went to the player with the best point total for the third round. That $10,000 prize went to Davis in yesterday's play. Scoring in the event is based on a modified Stableford system in which points are awarded for the players ' performance on each hole : 5 for eagle 2 for birdie 0 for par -1 for bogey and -3 for double-bogey or higher. It took a score of 16 points or better for three rounds to make it to the final round. Among the casualties were Hale Irwin Greg Norman and Jack Nicklaus who designed the course in the eastern foothills of the Rockies. ( AP ) Bies Hold Seniors Lead : Don Bies shot a 66 yesterday to take a two-stroke lead over Mike Hill and Rives McBee in the Seniors Showdown Classic in Jeremy Ranch Utah. Bies of La Quinta Calif finished with a 36-hole total of 132 12 under par over the hilly Jeremy Ranch Golf Club course. McBee who led after Friday's first round with a tournament-record of 64 fired a 70. Hill led briefly after moving to 12 under bogeys on the final two holes to finish with a 68. ( AP ) Little League Pennsylvania Team Gains : The Shippensburg team from Pennsylvania advanced to the Little League World Series yesterday by defeating Newark American of Delaware 8-2 in the final of the Eastern regional tournament at Bristol Conn. Bob Shannon pitched a complete game for Shippensburg which finished with a 15-0 record in tournament play. Shippensburg will meet the Cottage Hill team from Mobile Ala the representative from the Southern region in a first-round game Wednesday. The World Series which includes the four regional winners and four international teams begins Tuesday in Williamsport Pa. A team from Brooklyn Mich representing the Central region will meet the winner of last night's Western final between Cypress Calif and East Boise Idaho. <p> In the airy sitting room of the ranch house where he has lived for 48 years Byron Nelson holds a picture in his gnarled hands and peers back through time. In the frame a lean young man is in the perfect golf position his arms extended and the shaft of his club bowed head behind the ball body in absolute balance. <p> Nelson's gaze lingers on the frame and the deep lines of his face are reflected in the glass. He is the man with the tie and the starched shirt in the old black-and-white photo swinging with a tensile strength that fairly leaps through the decades and out of the picture he is the man with the bad hip sitting with his cane at arm's length. He shakes his head slowly puts a finger to his lips and smiles. <p> I do n't know about you he says in a voice strong and full of Texas but I do n't see anything at all wrong with that swing. \"<p> Not that Byron Nelson is last thing this 83-year-old man would do. It's not his style. This is about substance. This is the golf swing that inspired the United States Golf Association to name its driving robot Iron Byron. \"It is the swing that produced 52 United States tournament victories in an abbreviated career. And it is the swing that 50 years ago launched Nelson on the most remarkable streak in the history of this and perhaps any other sport. <p> With this swing Byron Nelson won 11 straight golf tournaments in 1945. Eleven straight. It has never been approached. The closest any golfer has come was Jackie Burke Jr who won four straight back in 1952. And with this golden anniversary of Nelson's unprecedented achievement the spotlight once again has focused on this quiet man from Fort Worth. During the months and weeks leading up to this weekend's GTE Byron Nelson Classic at the Four Seasons Resort at Las Colinas Nelson figures he has done many more interviews than he Not that I'm complaining he said. \"It still amazes me. Can you imagine All this about something a man did 50 years ago But I've enjoyed it enjoyed thinking about it and talking about it. \"<p> Nelson's eyes are clear and his hands  those huge calloused hands that made golf grips look like pencils  are steady. People used to say the hands are what gave him so much control what enabled him to keep the club on line longer than anyone before or since. No telling. But during one day recently he signed 1,520 advance copies of his Little Black Book a fascinating compendium of his notes beginning with the 1935 season and the signature never varied. <p> Consistency has always been Nelson's hallmark. Some of the numbers from his career seem unreal. During one stretch in the 1940's he made 113 straight cuts around the world a record that still stands. His career lasted just 11 52 victories. They are Sam Snead ( 81 ) Jack Nicklaus ( 70 ) Ben Hogan ( 63 ) and Arnold Palmer ( 60 ). And only Nicklaus was able to approach the number of tournament victories in the United States during his first 11 years on tour. Nicklaus won 51 in that stretch. <p> As impressive as those figures are they pale next to those from the Streak. That year Nelson not only won 11 straight. He won 18 of the 30 tournaments he entered. He finished second seven times and was out of the top five just once. His stroke average for the year was 68. 33 an all-time record and nearly a full stroke better than Snead's second-place total of 69. 23. Maybe the most mind-boggling number of all is Nelson's final-round stroke average. In crunch time he shot an average score of 67. 45. <p> The final-round stroke average that's really the reason why I won so much as I did he said. \" Snead did at Charlotte when he bogeyed the last hole and then I won the playoff that was a break. He could have scrambled around gotten a par at the last hole and then that would have been the end of it. The whole streak would have stopped at one. \"<p> It all began uneventfully enough with Byron and his running mate Jug McSpaden the Gold Dust Twins winning the Miami Four Ball by beating Denny Shute and Sam Byrd 8 and 6. Nothing unusual there. Nelson and McSpaden were a formidable team and played a lot of golf together since they both were rejected by the military during the war Nelson for a blood problem and McSpaden for severe sinusitis. <p> One of the things to note about the first victory is the presence of Hogan in the field. Critics of Nelson's accomplishments often point to what they say were war-depleted fields during the 1945 season. While it's obviously true that some good players were off to war the and Hogan played in 18. <p> All of that talk about no competition never really bothered me Byron said because you see I know how I played. Maybe I would n't have won 18 tournaments or 11 in a row but I played wonderfully well. \"<p> He surely did. During the 11 victories that stretched from early March through early August Nelson won by an average of seven strokes. There were only three real scares. The first was during tournament No. 2 at Charlotte when Snead's three-putt bogey at the last hole allowed Nelson to tie him at 272 and then defeat him after two 18-hole playoff rounds 69-69 to 69-73. The second scare came during victory No. 7 in June at the Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation when Nelson had to birdie five of the last six holes to shoot 63 and beat McSpaden by two strokes. <p> The third came in the second round of match play during the PGA Championship. That was when Mike phrase that summed up the entire year. With just four holes to play at Moraine Country Club in Dayton Ohio Turnesa was 2 up on Nelson. His shot to the 15th hole was 10 feet from the hole and he barely missed his birdie attempt. Nelson whose shot was inside Turnesa's made his putt. Nelson then squared the match with a birdie at 16 eagled the 17th to go 1 up and parred the last hole to protect his lead. <p> I was seven under and still lost is what Turnesa said. \"How the hell are you supposed to beat this man <p> Five decades later Nelson leans back in his chair and chuckles at that. He recalls that two weeks later at Tam O'Shanter he shot 269 to beat Hogan and Gene Sarazen by 11 strokes for his 10th straight victory. <p> I look back on it now and it just seems like a good long dream he said. \" my head for a period of a year and a half or so. But you know the thing was I consistently drove the ball in the fairway and when you're doing that you've got to be swinging well enough to put the ball on the green with your irons. \"<p> Always in the fairway. That was part of it. He has not been out of it since. After the following season he retired from golf at the age of 34 because he had done everything he set out to do and he had made enough money to buy the ranch 740 acres in the town about 15 miles outside Dallas. He and his first wife Louise who died in 1985 had always wanted a place like that. He named it Fairway Ranch and he still lives there. <p> Byron Nelson tells you that he has no regrets about golf and you believe him because everything about his demeanor tells you so. Sure complete the career Grand Slam but in those days it just cost too much to make the trip and he would have had to take a month off from his club job. He only made the crossing twice. No regret. Sure if he had stayed in the game longer he would have won a lot more tournaments but maybe then I would n't have gotten into television would n't have had my name associated with my Byron Nelson Classic you just never know. \"No regrets. <p> The only thing Nelson will admit to regretting is associating his name with a cigarette company back in 1936. A devout man who to this day attends prayer meetings and church at the Hilltop Church of Christ he never smoked drank chased women or stayed out late something Snead still ribs him about. But he needed the money and he took a $500 fee for endorsing a cigarette called 20 Grand. When the ads came out the letters came in. <p> Pain None of us realizes how many people we influence he said and there had been a lot of nice articles written about me about how I was a nice Christian man who did n't smoke or drink or do this or that and suddenly this ad comes out and I started getting some of the most terrible letters from schoolteachers and Sunday school teachers. They said ' Well there you are just like everybody else letting the almighty dollar get to you. ' Five hundred dollars. I was sick about that. It was the worst thing I've ever done. \"<p> He tried to give the money back but the company refused. He says now he prayed about it many many times brought it to the good Lord and said I'd never do anything again as long as I lived to influence people the wrong way. \"<p> Money has never been that important to Nelson. \"If I had made $10 million I now he said. And he means it. It amuses him to think of how much money he would have made winning 18 tournaments last year  it would have been somewhere in the $8 million range  and he chuckles at the notion. <p> I could not be happier than I am he said and as he stands to put the photo on a nearby table his major concession to age is evident. His walk is painfully slow the result of hip-replacement surgery several years ago. He does n't get to play much golf anymore but he will tell you at the urging of his second wife Peggy whom he married in 1986 about the 83 he shot a few weeks ago. The only thing troubling Nelson these days is the illness of Hogan who is in a Fort Worth hospital recovering from colon surgery. <p> Although the two men grew up together caddied together competed and traveled together and had many meals together Nelson has says he knows that Hogan does n't want company and he respects his wishes. It still seems to pain him though. <p> We are good friends and I understand the way he is Nelson said. \"He has never been outgoing. I've always respected his wishes about people leaving him alone. I'm very concerned that he's ill. \"<p> Nelson moves slowly into the family room of the ranch where many of his trophies and memorabilia are displayed. He ca n't move like he once did but his eye-hand coordination is still there. He is using a Cleveland Classic copy of his old McGregor driver as a cane and as he walks he spots an ant scurrying across the floor. He gets it with the butt of the club on his first try. <p> Less than a week from this day on the eve of the tournament that bears his name Byron Nelson would stand in the Ben Crenshaw Suite at the Four Seasons announcing the open at the resort in September and admiring the new Byron Nelson Eleven Straight Tournament Trophy a silver loving cup designed by Tiffany &; Co. He was worn out but enormously proud. <p> I feel like I'm the luckiest man in golf he would say. \"Not just because I have a few records attached to my name or anything like that. Just because of the way people have accepted me wherever I've gone welcomed me. It has been a wonderful year a wonderful year. \"<p> That it has. All because of a wonderful year 50 years ago a year that framed a feat that will never be duplicated and one that even the jaded golf professionals of today and the legions of golf fans recognize as something cosmic otherworldly. As the sun sets over Texas and the cool of the evening comes to the Dallas suburbs a pair of tourists sit at the feet of the giant Byron Nelson statue near the first tee and pose he stops and turns to the copper image of Nelson. He salutes. It is a gesture that comes from generations of golfers from all across time. <p> It was just a normal summer day when Allan Houston stopped his workout in midchurn stepped off the stationary bike and ducked into a film room at the Knicks ' practice facility. <p> Just once he wanted to see it for himself. Not the highlight version but the frame-by-frame account on a game film that rolled without announcers color commentators or SportsCenter anchors to infringe on the delicate balance of the moment. Completely alone Houston slipped in the videocassette marked Miami Game 5 : May 16 1999 and watched himself calmly search for one shaft of light one opening to part and flip up a one-handed runner that licked the rim tapped the glass and fell through the net as gently as a droplet. <p> The pull of gravity. Through its force the shot that hung in the air of Miami Arena  and held the future of the Knicks ' franchise in suspense  came down with eight-tenths of a second on the clock. At that instance the Heat's devastation became the Knicks ' salvation. <p> and I'll always keep with me said Houston who will be face to face with the Heat tonight at Madison Square Garden for the two rivals ' first meeting of the season. \"There was a lot riding on it. But I never think about that. I just think about the fact that we gave ourselves a chance. If you give yourself a chance all you can do is make or miss. \"<p> Under extreme circumstances the difference between the two can change everything. Something happened to Houston on the day he made what the Knicks refer to as the Shot. He does n't really see it but then the modest Houston is n't the type to check out his reflection as he walks by a mirror. <p> If he did he might notice what others do. The unassuming shooting guard who arrived in New York four years ago with his shoulders slumped head down and a voice that rarely broke a whisper has been heard stirring up his teammates Sometimes you hear him and you say to yourself ' Is that Allan ' Marcus Camby said. \"I have n't been around him all that long. But you can see the carry-over from the Shot. He's more vocal and he's a captain now. I guess everything was sort of put into motion that day. And I know one thing we all respect Allan. \"<p> This unselfish son of a coach whose natural instinct was to blend into the background behind Patrick Ewing and then Latrell Sprewell has finally found his place in the universe of basketball settling in next to the elite of the league. <p> Everyone wants to talk about the Shot Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. \"But he was struggling in that game until the fourth quarter. It showed his maturity to go from struggling to making a big shot when it matters most. From that moment on he started to separate himself from the other good shooting guards.  of a struggle for Houston much like it is for anyone shy in nature to find the courage to stand up and be seen in front of an audience. Often he would disappear at the Garden like a stand-in on the stage giving way to the takeover mentality of John Starks or Ewing. This was what the Knicks got for a $56 million investment A wallflower <p> It was a difficult initiation for Houston. He had left Detroit for a fast-paced city that did not seem to fit his loping ways for a coach who did not trust him to deliver in a big situation and for a team that was heavy on ego he did not possess. <p> When I came here there was n't a red carpet rolled out for me Houston said. \"But you know I would n't have had it any other way. I was pushed. \"<p> Instead of giving up his milk money to the bullying Knicks Houston pushed back pushed harder and process of discovery was not already under way when Houston delivered in Miami but that moment pressed the accelerator. <p> If he had missed who knows He might have slipped back. The franchise might have been dismantled. His coach would have most likely been fired and the ramifications might have left this most sensitive of players in mental disarray. <p> Instead the shot fell and the Knicks ' star-aligned run through the playoffs and into the finals began. Houston was there the whole way. If there is any statistic that reveals just how much impact Houston has on his team it's the record of the Knicks during the playoffs last year when he led the team in scoring : 5-0. <p> To me scorers when they score big and they lose they're not doing their job as superstars said the Knicks ' assistant coach Don Chaney who was the head coach at Detroit during Houston's 1993-94 rookie season. \"If you make the players around percent. If you get big numbers and no one else is scoring the chances are that one man is not going to beat anybody. \"<p> Even as stardom has become as comfortable a fit as a favorite chair for Houston even as the label of captain that Van Gundy asked him to wear on the team plane trip to training camp in Charleston S. C seems to suit him now Houston is just as unselfish as before. But there is a difference between deferring with a pedestrian pass in the perimeter world he used to live in as the shooter and creating opportunities for others with an aggressive drive to the basket. <p> He's still a great shooter but you see him being so assertive now said Grant Hill Houston's former Detroit teammate. \"I was watching the playoffs and I think that's the biggest change. He's driving to the basket and kicking the ball out to his teammates. He's a complete player. \"<p> know if it was the Shot or maybe just the accumulation of his run in the playoffs and his experience on the Olympic team this summer but if that shot is what catapulted him great Van Gundy said. <p> Whatever it is Houston has sprung to life in the early stages of this season. After a career of shooting in the high 30's and low 40's before January Houston has opened the season hitting at a rate of 53 percent and averaging 22. 4 points a game. <p> I ca n't say the Shot made Allan Houston because he was a player prior to that but it really to me took him to another level in terms of superstardom Chaney said. \"I think now Allan believes he can score on anyone in the league. And I think late in a game he knows he can make any basket. \"<p> He has seen proof sitting alone in front of a VCR. <p> I do Houston said. \"This is my sixth year in the league and I went through a lot to get to that shot. But if people want to consider it that fine. To me it's not a turning point or a beginning. The bottom line is the shot went in. \"<p> http : //www. nytimes. com <p> There was no way out this time so Brett Favre waited as gravity and two Washington Redskins linebackers conspired against him. <p> LaVar Arrington got to him first Jeremiah Trotter a split second after and the forces of man and nature pushed Favre's left knee out from under him twisted and exposed helpless in a way that has ended so many football careers. <p> Favre the Green Bay Packers quarterback hobbled to his feet teary-eyed according to some and was soon scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging exam that could have revealed any number of injuries. The film showed a slightly sprained lateral collateral ligament an injury he could continue to play on. Then it showed something else : tendons and cartilage as strong and as thick as telephone cables. <p> The doctors were amazed Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman said Friday. \"The ligaments were that of a 22-year-old swimmer. \"<p> It could be called luck if Favre 33 had n't cheated the fates so many times during his 12-year career  alive his streak of 165 starts at a position that may be the most hazardous in sports. ( The former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski is second on the list with 116. ) Favre has been sacked 337 times for 2,190 yards and has withstood the punishment time after time. <p> In an era when so many of his peers have been knocked out of the game  Steve Young and Troy Aikman in particular  Favre has continued to thrive in the face of linemen who grow bigger every year. <p> There have been times when injuries could have kept me out and there have been times when injuries should have kept me out said Favre who was born in Gulfport Miss. \"But as my mom always said I'm hardheaded. \"<p> The only N. F. L. player to win three Most Valuable Player awards Favre is poised to wrap his hands around a fourth. The Packers are 7-1 as they prepare to play host to the Detroit Lions on Sunday consecutive spirit of his sport. <p> It's almost come to be expected Sherman said. \"You just do n't expect him to miss time because he expects so much from himself. I actually think he wills himself to heal faster than the other guy because he wants to play so badly. And it has nothing to do with consecutive games or any records. What is important to him is that his teammates respect him. \"<p> Favre said : The last thing you want to do is keep starting and look bad. Nowadays guys sit out all the time. It's almost like they have the upper hand. But how can you stand to be on the sideline or in the locker room when you can be out there really contributing <p> Favre will wear a brace on his left knee for a few more weeks he will not need surgery. The Packers had a bye after the Redskins game but Favre insisted he would have been able to play the His body remains sturdy at an age when many other athletes are breaking down. And considering his early years in the league that is somewhat of an anomaly. <p> Favre once played the role of good-time Charlie to the hilt. He drank. He was hospitalized in 1996 for an addiction to the painkiller Vicodin. He sometimes arrived at practice with his hair a disheveled reminder of the night's activity. It was the stuff of burnout of Mickey Mantle looking back and wishing he had treated his body better. <p> Had he continued down that path Favre said There is no question that if I was sitting here it would be in a different role or not as good or not here. <p> Or not living. \"<p> Favre following terms of his drug rehabilitation agreed not to drink alcohol for two years. He switched to taking non-narcotic and nonsteroidal drugs. He also married in 1996 and has two daughters with his wife Deanna.  Sherman said. \"I think he was at a crossroads in his life and he sat down and decided what was important to him and went that way. And it did n't include some of the things that were pulling him down from that side of the fence. \"<p> Since joining the team in a trade in 1992 Favre's constancy with the Packers is one of the few stable things in the constantly changing league. His primary receiver has changed from Sterling Sharpe to Antonio Freeman to Bill Schroeder to Donald Driver. Sherman is his third coach after Mike Holmgren and Ray Rhodes ( though as Sherman pointed out the offense Favre has run is virtually unchanged. ) <p> The league has expanded teams have moved to new cities and divisions have been realigned but Favre continues to sink his roots deeper into the town that lives for green-and-yellow Sundays. <p> Favre said his body would give out before his arm ever did though neither one seems close to expiring still otherworldly. <p> We always kid him about coming off the mound so to speak when he throws like a pitcher does Doug Pederson Favre's backup said. \"When he does that somebody's chest is going to get caved in. To still have the same arm strength having gone through some arm problems wrist problems thumb problems is phenomenal. \"<p> Safety Darren Sharper put it this way : He's got that country-boy strength. Just real tough. \"<p> Some of Favre's strength is in his genes. At 6 feet 2 inches 225 pounds he is hardly small. But Favre is also not a weight-lifting fiend. A lot of what manifests itself as physical strength is mental. <p> The part that is amazing to me Tennessee Titans General Manager Floyd Reese said Friday is not just him playing injured or playing with pain but playing as well as normal when he's hurt. It ball is in your hands for that 10 seconds and you're running around or dropping back to pass. After the play or after the game the pain will come back but they can wipe out the pain while they play. \"<p> Sherman agreed. <p> I think the great players like Brett all of their energy is in focusing Sherman said. \"They have nothing left that is going to distinguish pleasure and pain. That's what separates him from everybody else. When he plays golf he can tell you every score every hole everything that happened on that golf course. On a football field he comes to the sideline and he can tell you exactly where everybody was on every play. He has tremendous recall and that's due to his ability to super-focus on the game. \"<p> Sherman also said that the view of Favre as a bumpkin could n't be more off. Sure Favre dashed off after Friday's practice so he would have Pederson. And yes Favre keeps boots and a camouflage suit in the back of his truck. But only a privileged few see Favre decoding the daily crossword puzzle or reading a book at his locker. <p> He does n't want anybody to know Sherman said. <p> Favre seems comfortable with the idea of one day fading from the spotlight. Retirement can stop Favre's starting streak and he has said that he is entertaining the thought. While he has n't picked a year to retire many people including Sherman believe that Favre can play into his 40's. He has indicated that he wo n't. <p> He can see a quieter simpler life free from being a Sunday fixture from being the guy who always punches the clock and gets up from the devastating tackle. <p> I will miss the game Favre said. \"If you retire at the top of the game maybe it's because you're tired of the game.  n't want to go through this every day. That part of it I do n't think I will miss. There may be times when I go ' Maybe I made a mistake ' but most of the time it will be : ' I'm glad I do n't have to worry about that today. I'm glad I do n't have to be Brett Favre this week. \"' <p> URL : http : //www. nytimes. com <p> One jump on a practice rink changed the face of the United States figure skating team Sunday ushering 17-year-old Emily Hughes into the Olympics. She will replace Michelle Kwan who was forced to pull out with a groin injury leaving Sasha Cohen as the only realistic candidate to uphold the United States ' medal hopes. <p> When 25-year-old Kwan told skating officials here early Sunday that she would have to withdraw ending her last hopes for a gold medal Hughes and her family were eating a sushi dinner Saturday night at Daruma of Tokyo her favorite Japanese restaurant near their home in Great Neck N.

Kwan finished a disappointing third four years ago after winning silver in 1998. <p> Kwan said Saturday that she was thinking of Emily's father John Hughes the caller ID gave away that it was from United States Figure Skating Association officials.

After a brief conversation he gave the thumbs-up sign and passed the phone to Emily. <p> The Hugheses were asked not to say anything for 12 hours. <p> They told us we could n't tell anyone so we had to leave the restaurant Hughes said via conference call from her home. \"It's a little hard to be quiet because we were so excited. \"<p> Alongside Emily at dinner were Sarah John and Amy Hughes as well as Emily's agent Art Kaminsky and his wife. On their way out Kaminsky said they stopped briefly to look at a television showing the start of the pairs short program which kicked off Olympic figure skating Saturday. <p> Back in Turin Kwan's withdrawal began what turned into a disappointing day for the United States. The team in the men's halfpipe but did not win a medal in the men's downhill short-track speedskating or the men's luge singles. Its total of three medals after two days of competition matched the total in Salt Lake City. <p> Kwan arrived here full of hope that she could compete for the gold medal that was missing from her Olympic career. A previous groin injury had put that in doubt forcing her to withdraw from the national championships in January. She was named to the Olympic team after petitioning for a spot then proving that she was healthy by performing for skating officials about two weeks ago. <p> But in her first practice here Kwan landed badly while attempting a triple flip and United States team doctors said she pulled a groin muscle. This one ended her Olympic career. <p> Kwan tried to hold back tears during her news conference but halfway through she cried. <p> I've learned it's not about the gold Kwan said. \"It's regrets. I tried my hardest and if I do n't win the gold it's O. K. I'll be happy. \"<p> NBC was excited enough about another Hughes in the Olympics to have a camera crew at her house early Sunday morning in the middle of a snowstorm. <p> Hughes remained grounded in Long Island because of the snow but she said there was no rush to get to Turin because the short program is not until Feb. 21. In fact Kaminsky said Emily would probably attend school as usual Monday if it is not canceled because of the weather. <p> Emily is a much longer shot to win a medal than her sister was. The most obvious point of comparison is that Sarah finished third at the national championships in 2002 before winning the gold at Salt Lake City Emily finished third at the nationals last month before temporarily losing her spot on the Olympic team to Kwan. <p> But the program Sarah performed in Salt Lake City was more difficult than Cohen's or Slutskaya won the silver and Cohen place fourth in 2002. ) The level of difficulty in Emily's program this year does not approach Cohen's. <p> At her best particularly under the new scoring system  which leaves much less room for discretion on the technical side  Hughes could contend for a spot in the top 10. It is her first season competing on the senior level. <p> At nationals Hughes fell attempting a triple jump and completed only four in her long program. The top skaters often land as many as seven some in combination with double or triple jumps. The third member of the United States team 16-year-old Kimmie Meissner completed seven triples in her performance at the nationals but still finished far behind Cohen when the points were totaled. <p> At nationals when I finished third and made the world championships team I was just so excited with that because it was such a big step up from last year Hughes said. \"For me to great dream so far. \"<p> But the skater who now has a chance to step out of Kwan's considerable shadow is Cohen who enters her second Olympics as a medal contender. At last year's world championships Cohen finished second to Slutskaya who is the favorite here. <p> Cohen reacted graciously to Kwan's withdrawal. \"I was a little bit shocked she said. \"I know how tough it is to come back from an injury. It's great that she tried and I'm sorry that it did n't work out. \"<p> Cohen 21 skated a flawless short program in Salt Lake City only to fall doing a triple-triple combination in the long program. <p> Kwan's disappointment in 2002 was even more acute. She was the favorite but fell in her long program and finished third. It was the second straight Games in which she failed to come through with the gold. In 1998 she finished second to another teenager from the United trying for a third Olympics. At last year's world championships she finished fourth in her first exposure to the new scoring system which puts a premium on the kind of difficult elements she was not doing. <p> Her intensified efforts to add those elements Kwan said led to her injury-plagued season. A hip injury knocked her out of several international competitions and the Grand Prix series. A groin injury in December kept her from the nationals an event she had won a record-tying nine times. <p> To petition successfully onto the Olympic team Kwan had to skate her short and long programs for a team of observers Jan. 27 at a rink in Artesia Calif. She performed so well that Bob Horen chairman of the United States Figure Skating Association's international committee said he believed Kwan could win the gold. <p> But those hopes crashed during Kwan's first practice in Turin. When she was forced to withdraw Kwan advised Hughes not to forget to enjoy herself. <p> . \"I'm sure she'll have a great time and I'm sure she'll make the country proud. \"<p> Kwan said she would head home immediately. \"I do n't want to be a distraction she said. With that she left the Olympic stage to Cohen and Hughes. <p> URL : http : //www. nytimes. com A pulled groin muscle forced Michelle Kwan to withdraw from the Olympics. ( Photo by Jeremiah Bogert/The New York Times ) ( pg. D2 ) <p> Even if Mayor David N. Dinkins can reassure investors that New York City's finances are well managed the city will probably pay sharply higher interest costs the next time it tries to raise money in the bond market financial experts say. <p> Mr. Dinkins will face an important test on Thursday they say when the administration is to release a revised financial plan showing how it will begin to grapple with a worsening economy and growing budget deficits. <p> In the unlikely event that the city's financial monitors and the credit rating agencies find the plan inadequate the city could have trouble selling the $950 million in bonds that it plans to issue next month bond traders and analysts say. <p> But even if Mr. Dinkins passes this test  and he has already taken a series of increasingly harsh steps in the last few days to reassure the financial community  the traders and analysts say the city's credibility with investors remains damaged from an earlier period of confusing signals and commitments. ' There Is Skepticism ' <p> I think the city a bond broker and president of Titus &; Donnelly. \"It is a matter of what they are going to have to pay. \"<p> One underwriter of city bond issues who asked not to be identified observed There is skepticism about the city's sincerity its ability to deal with the budget gaps in a fiscally responsible way. \"<p> Already the City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman is forecasting that a $1. 3 billion short-term note sale later this month will cost the city $7 million more than previously planned this year because of rising interest costs. <p> The city could be forced to pay tens of millions of dollars in higher interest costs on its next sale of long-term bonds even after taking into account overall changes in interest rates analysts said. <p> City officials say they are aware of the concerns of investors and planning an extended information campaign to convince them that the city is capable of managing its affairs even in the face of an economic downturn. <p> If access to the markets at a reasonable price Ms. Holtzman said. \"The fact that the administration knows it will have to run that gantlet is an important discipline. \"Bond Sale Postponed <p> The city's Budget Director Philip R. Michael said the administration was focusing on those concerns as it made a major effort to prepare what is usually a routine revision of its financial plan. <p> Because of concern over the next bond sale Mr. Dinkins and Ms. Holtzman agreed to postpone it by a month until December to give them more time to reach out to investors. <p> The city is planning to go ahead with a sale of $1. 3 billion in short-term notes later this month. But rather than holding an auction as it has in the last few years it will negotiate the interest rate with the city's underwriters. <p> Aides to Miss Holtzman said the city's strategy was governed by the concern that it had a complicated story to tell investors. Since-tax exempt notes are the story is easier to convey. Unsettled Municipal Bond Market <p> Similarly they said when a note is a known commodity auctions often produce lower interest costs. But when sales are large or complicated or the market is in flux negotiations may allow the city to sell bonds paying slightly less interest. City officials are hoping that with few other note sales scheduled this month the notes will do well  and thus ease the way for the bond sale next month. <p> One backdrop to the city's worsening credit picture is an unsettled municipal bond market in which investors are forsaking riskier investments in cities with problems in favor of safer higher-rated issues. This has driven up interest costs for cities with problems. <p> Another is New York City's special place in the bond market. It is the largest borrower in the municipal bond market it is home to much of the municipal bond industry and its brush with bankruptcy in the 1970's was one of the seminal events in . <p> During one confusing week in early October  in which Mr. Dinkins agreed to a 5. 5 percent salary increase for teachers announced a plan to hire thousands of police officers and warned that 15,000 city workers might have to be laid off  the price of New York City bonds fell sharply and the yields rose. Cut in Rating Is Possible <p> The administration's confusing signals confounded the bond market. They came two weeks after the city completed its most successful bond sale in which the city had to pay the lowest interest rates since Mr. Dinkins took office. Bear Stearns the lead underwriter either lost money or narrowly broke even on the deal. Underwriters usually a group of investment banks agree before a bond sale to buy the whole issue and then try to resell it at a profit. <p> After the bond prices fell Standard &; Poor's put the city's $13 billion of outstanding bonds on its Credit Watch list and warned that if the city did not get its rating drop from A to BBB  the lowest that is still called investment grade by the rating services just above what would be in effect junk bonds. \"<p> In the next few weeks as the administration rushed to reassure the financial community by cutting spending warning of as many as 35,000 layoffs and pressuring unions for lower wage settlements bond prices stopped falling. But they remained close to the high levels of early October. Lower Return <p> On Friday long-term city bonds were yielding a return of about 8. 6 percent after going as high as 8. 8 percent in some transactions traders said. Traders said New York City bonds were already trading as if they had a BBB rating or lower. In early October they were selling to yield 8. 25 percent. A bond's yield is what the investor who buys it gets on it. This can be more or less than the interest paid by the borrower. If the yield is higher the buyer will of the bond. If the yield is lower the buyer will pay more than the face value of the bond. <p> One way of measuring the city's declining credit is to compare the difference between the yields on New York City bonds and the yields on other municipal bonds today and when the city last sold bonds on Sept. 14. <p> In September the city sold 21-year bonds with a yield of 8. 05 percent while other similar A-rated municipal bonds were yielding 7. 65 percent according to the Delphis Hanover Corporation. Sensitive to the City <p> Today New York City bonds are trading at a yield of 8. 6 percent while similar bonds are trading to yield 7. 5 percent. So by this standard the city's interest costs increased by seven-tenths of 1 percent. <p> That translates into $7,000 in extra interest costs each year for each $1 million in bonds sold. Assuming the city paid the same extra interest for an entire year's borrowing of about $4 billion and all the bonds matured in extra interest costs. City bonds have varying terms ranging up to 30 years. <p> Since many bond traders and investors live or at least work in New York City they are especially sensitive to the political and social currents in the city from homelessness to dirty streets and from fear of crime to City Hall skirmishes. <p> The markets like predictability and routine said Alan J. Proctor executive director of the state Financial Control Board. \"The environment of the last month was unpredictability. The administration is now making extraordinary efforts to show that it is going about a predictable process. \"' Very Blunt Instrument ' <p> He said the difference between the first week of October and now is like the difference between night and day. \"<p> But Kurt van Kuller managing director for research at Lebenthal &; Company said that even if the city takes strong action and keeps its A bond rating from Standard &; Poor's the bond market might not react for a long time.  Mr. van Kuller said. \"The way it moves is in big swings. I do n't think that one bit of news will make a difference. \"<p> And even if the Mayor calms concerns about the city's management Mr. van Kuller noted that other problems remain. \"The issue will focus not so much on what is he doing next year he said but on the general problem of resources and the city's economy. \"<p> Central New Jersey an international center of the pharmaceutical industry is being pushed to center stage in the United States ' campaign to contain health costs. <p> Scattered across the state's midsection  in the rolling hills here the corporate campuses of Princeton the urban clutter of New Brunswick and elsewhere  is the world's largest concentration of companies that create and market prescription drugs companies whose steady growth and investment have been the envy of other corporations even in recessionary years. <p> Now the pharmaceutical industry finds itself under siege from insurers hospitals Congress and the Clinton Administration which calls the containment of health-care costs a major priority in its fight to reduce the Federal deficit. On Friday the President singled out the industry for criticism calling its prices shocking and saying drug companies are spending too much on advertising and lobbying. <p> In New Jersey sometimes called the medicine chest of the nation because it is home to the main research arms of 10 of the world's 18 largest drug companies the big question they can continue to stand out as models of growth profitability and by many measures community involvement. Fear of Turning Gray <p> Some fear that economic and political pressure will transform the industry from a cutting-edge producer of high-technology products into just another graying American manufacturer. That has threatening implications across a region reeling from huge manufacturing job losses including the impending shutdown of the General Motors assembly plant in Tarrytown N. Y and thousands of layoffs by I. B. M. <p> In what some analysts call an omen for the industry Bristol-Myers Squibb said in October that it was cutting 2,000 jobs in its pharmaceutical group based in Princeton. <p> New Federal regulations combined with fierce competition in the industry are going to drive the margins out of the pharmaceutical business over the next five years said Raymond C. Egan executive vice president of the Bristol-Myers Squibb group which has 38,000 employees. <p> Although fewer than 300 people would be laid off in New Jersey where the pharmaceutical group has 6,000 state through attrition. ' Pressure on Prices ' <p> There is certainly going to be increased pressure on prices and adjustments have to be made said Patricia Danzon a professor of health-care management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. <p> She said cuts may come first in administration and sales. Other experts expect cuts in research and development which like administration and sales are heavily concentrated in New Jersey. <p> The health-care industry in the United States has been the most innovative in the world said Jack Herdklotz the president of Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals a German company that built its Somerville headquarters in 1970. It is completing work on a $20 million molecular neurobiology research center here to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. Traditions of Involvement <p> He said that to contain costs Hoechst-Roussel was considering producing more generic drugs and relying more on licensing or other cooperative ventures with outside laboratories and researchers. <p> Cutbacks could affect more than the companies have long traditions of community involvement in New Jersey. <p> In New Brunswick a once-declining industrial city where Johnson &; Johnson built a new headquarters in 1975 the company in January opened a day-care and parenting center for teen-age mothers at New Brunswick High School. <p> In Nutley Hoffmann-La Roche won an award last year from the Environmental Protection Agency in part for its programs to recycle waste. Other drug makers have been widely cited for volunteer work and for gifts to community programs. ' The Most Admired I\n"
